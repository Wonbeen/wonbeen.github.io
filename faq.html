          <h1>FAQ</h1>

          <ul>
            <li><p>Q: How can I purchase a skateboard?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: You can start by either getting a complete skateboard or building a custom. If you're new and don't have anyone around you who skates, we recommend you get a complete. If you do have some friends who are skaters, ask them for spare parts and try buying other necessary parts. This way, you can cut down on your expenses.</p></li>
            <li><p>Q: What size deck do I get?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: By now, you might have realized there are various types of board sizes. Deck widths vary from 7.5 to even 9 inches. Although some people might think their feet size determines their board size, but it is really up to your preference. Try visiting your local shops and ask if you can try out a specific board size. If you don't have a store in your area, just keep in mind that either a 7.75 inch or 8 inch decks are the most common. Or just go with your favorite design. But really, it's up to your personal preference and if you start skating, you'll quickly learn which deck you want to use. Asking skaters at a skatepark is also not a bad idea. </p></li>
            <li><p>Q: Do I need safety equipment for skateboarding?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: Yes, when it's your first time on concrete, you would need a helmet, at the least. If you want, you can get elbow and knee pads. The normal kind you would get for a cycling or any other sport would work</p></li>
            <li><p>Q: I got my first board, how do I start skateboarding?</p></li>
            <li><p>A: As they say: practice makes perfect. Start out by learning which foot goes first and how to push. It's important to get your balance down before starting to learn any tricks, so make sure you get pretty comfortable with your board. Learn how to get on your board, stop, and get off your board. Once you're ready, start learning simple tricks--we recommend you start out with the ollie. </p></li>
